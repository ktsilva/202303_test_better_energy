From Dale:

This task is not meant to be an accurate representation of the work you'll be expected to do.

It is instead intended to allow us to see how you approach the problem. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses are encouraged beyond the scope of the questions outlined below.

It is understood some of these concepts may be unfamiliar to you, therefore you're asked to do research where necessary to determine definitions.

The data presented is a raw download from three operational PV installations, therefore data errors can be expected - try to identify these.

You may use any tools at your disposal to complete the analysis, including Excel, Python, R or any other method.

You will be expected to present the results of your analysis during the next interview.

Quantitative Questions:
- What is the approximate DC capacity of each PV installation in kWp?
- What is the approximate performance ratio (PR) of each installation in 2018, 2019 and 2020?
- What percentage of the data could be considered invalid?

Qualitative Questions
- How might this data be transmitted between a datalogger and an online portal?
- For a few example datapoints explain why you flagged them as invalid.
- If there is a seasonal difference in performance, explain why this might be the case.

Additional Questions
- How might you approach visualisation of the data to inform non-subject experts of the issues seen?
- What other details can you infer about the parks? Can you estimate their approximate location?
